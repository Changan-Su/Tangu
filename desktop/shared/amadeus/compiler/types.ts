//
// A note is ONE `.md` file. Its blocks live INLINE, each delimited by an open marker
// `<!-- a <id> -->` (an HTML comment, invisible in Obsidian); a block's content is the
// markdown from its marker to the next marker. The 2D layout lives in the note's
// frontmatter (`amadeus_layout`). Content is stored exactly once (inline) — so loading is
// just parsing the file; there is no projection and nothing to reconcile.
//
// A block whose content is exactly `![[note#blockid]]` is a cross-note embed: Amadeus
// resolves it by scanning the target note's markers and renders it read-only.
